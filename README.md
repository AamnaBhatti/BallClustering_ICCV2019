+ Realistic setting for clustering face tracks in videos
+ Number of clusters is not known
+ Background character face tracks are not removed and need to be resolved
+ <strong>Ball Cluster Learning</strong>: a new loss function that carves feature space into balls of a learned radius that can be used as a stopping criterion of agglomerative clustering

### Dataset
We use 6 episodes of season 1 of <em>The Big Bang Theory</em> and 6 episodes of season 5 of <em>Buffy - The Vampire Slayer</em>. Face track labels are resolved between background characters.

Original tracks were provided by:  
M. BÃ¤uml, et al. [Semi-supervised Learning with Constraints for Person Identification in Multimedia Data](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~makarand/papers/CVPR2013.pdf). CVPR 2013.
